## List Section Selection

### Intro

Developers often work with lists — lists of DOM elements, HTML collections, arrays, etc.  In the upcoming project, you'll paginate a long list of students to make the list more manageable and user friendly.  Here’s some lightweight practice working with a short list of DOM elements.  You’ll use JavaScript to make changes to small sections of the list.

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome dev tools console.  Then follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, clicking the buttons on the page should highlight your desired section selection.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out in the `#code-adventures` channel in your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
